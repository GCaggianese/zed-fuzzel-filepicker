# zed-fuzzel-filepicker

A recursive fuzzy file picker for Zed editor using Fuzzel, inspired by Emacs' dired navigation.

## What it does

Browse and open files with fuzzy search and recursive directory navigation
Press the keybind and fuzzy-search files, and open them directly in Zed from within Zed.

## Why

When I started trying out Zed the first thing I missed was dired's file picker, this tries to close that gap bringing it to Zed.

## Demo



## Requirements

- [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/) with `zeditor` CLI tool
- [Fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel) (or rofi/dmenu — see adapting section)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (faster alternative to `find`)
- Any Unix-like system

## Installation

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S fuzzel fd zed

# Debian (zed via official install)
sudo apt install fuzzel fd-find
```

### 2. Set up the script

```bash
# Copy script to your local bin
cp fuzzel-file-picker ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/fuzzel-file-picker
```

### 3. Configure Zed

**Add to your `tasks.json`** (`~/.config/zed/tasks.json`):

```json
[
  {
    "label": "file-picker",
    "command": "~/.local/bin/fuzzel-file-picker \"${ZED_DIRNAME:-$ZED_WORKTREE_ROOT}\" > /dev/null 2>&1",
    "use_new_terminal": false,
    "reveal": "never",
    "hide": "always",
    "show_summary": false,
    "show_command": false
  }
]
```

**Add to your `keymap.json`** (`~/.config/zed/keymap.json`):

```json
{
  "bindings": {
    "space .": ["task::Spawn", { "task_name": "file-picker" }]
  }
}
```

*(Change `space .` to whatever keybind you prefer)*

## Usage

1. **Open Zed** in your project
2. **Press `Space + .`** (or your keybind)
3. **Navigate:**
   - Type to fuzzy-search files/directories
   - Select `..` to go up a directory
   - Select a directory to dive deeper
   - Select a file to open it in Zed
   - You can create new files too
4. **Esc to cancel** at any point

## How it works

- Uses `fd` to list files/directories
- Fuzzel does the fuzzy-search interface
- Recursively navigates directories until you select\create a file
- Opens selected file via `zeditor` CLI

### Use a different launcher

I guess you can replace `fuzzel --dmenu` with:
- **rofi:** `rofi -dmenu -p`
- **dmenu:** `dmenu -p`
- **fzf:** `fzf --prompt`
But I haven't tried it yet.

## Integration from Zed

This pattern works for integrating **any external tool** with Zed via tasks:
1. Write a script that outputs to stdout/stderr
2. Add task to `tasks.json` with output redirected
3. Bind task to keybind in `keymap.json`

This is really cool as let's Zed be easily extensive!

## Troubleshooting

**"zeditor: command not found"**
- Install Zed's CLI: Open Zed → `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Install CLI"

**"fd: command not found"**
- In some systems `fd` is called diferent, you'll need to adapt the script to yours.

Open an issue or PR. Hack it however you want!
Using this task integration pattern for other tools?
I'd love to see what you build! Drop a link in the issues or tag this repo. Building a collection of Zed integrations would be amazing.
